  The use of equivalent beam models to estimate the dynamical
    characteristics of complex tall buildings has been investigated by several
    authors. The main reason is the structural response estimation to stochastic
    loads, such as wind and earthquake, using a reduced number of degrees of
    freedom, which reduces the computational costs and therefore gives the
    designer an effective tool to explore a number of possible structural
    solutions. In this paper, a novel approach to calibrate the mechanical and
    dynamical features of a complete 3D Timoshenko beam, i.e., describing bending,
    shear and torsional behavior, is proposed. This approach is based on
    explicitly considering the sub-structures of the tall building. In particular,
    the frames, shear walls and lattice sub-systems are modeled as equivalent
    beams, constrained by means of rigid diaphragms at different floors. The
    overall dynamic features of the tall building are obtained by equating the
    deformation energy of an equivalent sandwich beam with that of the selected
    sub-structures. Finally, the 3D Timoshenko equivalent beam parameters are
    calibrated by minimizing a suitable function of modal natural frequencies and
    static displacements. The closed form modal solution of the equivalent beam
    model is used to obtain the response to stochastic loads.
