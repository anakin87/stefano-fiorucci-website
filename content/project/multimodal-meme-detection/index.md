As part of the DANKMEMES competition (EVALITA 2020), I developed a model for multimodal detection of political memes. The proposed solution is a feed-forward neural network that leverages pretrained embeddings, both for text and image representation. I ranked 2nd, at a small distance from the winner (Tor Vergata University team).
