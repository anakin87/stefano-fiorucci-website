This project aims to show that a naive and simple baseline for fact checking can be built by combining dense retrieval and a textual entailment task. In a nutshell, the flow is as follows:

- the user enters a factual statement
- the relevant passages are retrieved from the knowledge base using dense retrieval
- the system computes the text entailment between each relevant passage and the statement, using a Natural Language Inference model
- the entailment scores are aggregated to produce a summary score.

I also added the feature "Explain using a Large Language Model", which is based on prompting google/flan-t5-large!
