Conferences and events in the medical sector often involve numerous speakers, presentations and scientific works. In this challenge, presented by a real client, we used Natural Language Processing to make sense of the sizable amount of material that is the output of such conferences by drawing the most relevant insights for both participants and sponsors. We developed a suite of NLP and information extraction tools for the healthcare domain.
