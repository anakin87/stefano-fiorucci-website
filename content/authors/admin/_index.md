💫 Structural Engineer turned Software Engineer with a passion for exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

🔍 Formerly at 01S for 5 years, I specialized in information extraction and retrieval from unstructured documents, making valuable information accessible to Italian citizens.

💙 Currently, I am proud to be part of deepset, contributing to Haystack, the open-source NLP/LLM Framework. I enjoy engaging with a vibrant community of users and contributors.

In my spare time:

* I often take meditative walks 🚶‍♂️
* I dedicate myself to social volunteering ⭐
* I am part of a theatre group, I read, I watch films... 🎭
